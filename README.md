# Heart Failure Prediction Project ❤️🩺

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart failure using a dataset containing various health indicators. Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally, and early prediction can be crucial for timely intervention. 🚨

**Dataset:** 📊
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Mention Dataset Source, e.g., Kaggle - Heart Failure Prediction Dataset]. It includes 11 features such as Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, etc., along with the target variable 'HeartDisease'.

**Methodology:** 🛠️
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:
1.  Data Loading and Initial Inspection 📂
2.  Data Preprocessing (Handling categorical features using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding) ✨
3.  Exploratory Data Analysis (Visualizations, Correlation Analysis, Outlier Detection) 🔍📈
4.  Model Training (Evaluating various classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost) 🤖
5.  Model Evaluation (Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and ROC AUC score) ✅💯

**How to Run the Notebook:** ▶️

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine (we'll cover this in a later step, or you can download the notebook directly).
2.  Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) installed.
3.  Install the required libraries (we'll create a `requirements.txt` file for this later). 📦
4.  Open the notebook file (`your_notebook_name.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
5.  Run the cells sequentially. 👇
