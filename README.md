# Heart Failure Prediction Project
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart failure using a dataset containing various health indicators. Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally, and early prediction can be crucial for timely intervention.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Mention Dataset Source, e.g., Kaggle - Heart Failure Prediction Dataset]. It includes 11 features such as Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, etc., along with the target variable 'HeartDisease'.

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:
1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection
2. Data Preprocessing (Handling categorical features using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Visualizations, Correlation Analysis, Outlier Detection)
4. Model Training (Evaluating various classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost)
5. Model Evaluation (Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and ROC AUC score)

   **To run this notebook:**

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine (we'll cover this in a later step, or you can download the notebook directly).
2.  Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) installed.
3.  Install the required libraries (we'll create a `requirements.txt` file for this later).
4.  Open the notebook file (`your_notebook_name.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
5.  Run the cells sequentially.
